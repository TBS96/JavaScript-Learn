// To show output in browser's console (most recommended):
console.log(60+50);
console.log('Hello World');

// To show output in webpage:
// document.write(50+50);
// document.write("Hello world")

// To show output as alert when opening page or reloading page (not much recommended to show output. mainly used in page submissions):
alert('Hello Everyone');
alert(40+40);

// To show output in terminal with the help of node js (only console.log() will work. alert() & document.write() wont work in terminal as these two are mainly based on browsers):
// console.log(30+25)
