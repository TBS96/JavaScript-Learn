    <h1>Hello World</h1>



    <!-- Inline JS, where JS code is written inside body -->
    <script>
        console.log(10+30);
    </script>
</body>
</html>



<!-- 
    For professional work purpose, inline js is also not recommended, as <script> will contain many lines of code, so it gets difficult to find & manage the code, while doing professional work.
    But still, we can do it, only for learning and practice purpose.
